Abstraction means working with something you know how to use without knowing how it works internally.
Encapsulation allows binding data and associated methods together in a unit i.e class.

These principles together allows a programmer to define an interface for applications,
i.e. to define all tasks the program is capable to execute and their respective input and output data.

A good example is a television set. We donâ€™t need to know the inner workings of a TV, in order to use it.
All we need to know is how to use the remote control (i.e the interface for the user to interact with the TV).

Direct access to data can be restricted by making required attributes or methods private, 
just by prefixing it's name with one or two underscores.

An attribute or a method starting with:
no underscores is a public one.
a single underscore is private, however, still accessible from outside.
double underscores is strongly private and not accessible from outside.
